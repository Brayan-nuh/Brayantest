            <h1>VACCINES:</h1>
            <h2>Vaccines for Dogs</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <h3>Core Vaccines (Recommended for all dogs):</h3>
                <li>Rabies: Protects against rabies, a fatal disease that can be transmitted to humans. Rabies vaccination is required by law in many areas.</li>
                <li>Distemper: A serious, often fatal viral disease affecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems.</li>
                <li>Parvovirus (CPV): A highly contagious virus that causes gastrointestinal illness in puppies and unvaccinated dogs.</li>
                <li>Canine Parainfluenza: Often combined with other vaccines, it protects against respiratory infections.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>Non-Core Vaccines (Recommended based on risk factors):</h3>
                <li>Bordetella bronchiseptica (Kennel Cough): Commonly given to dogs that spend time in kennels, dog parks, or daycare.</li>
                <li>Leptospirosis: A bacterial infection that can affect the liver and kidneys; it's more common in areas with standing water or wildlife.</li>
                <li>Lyme Disease: A vaccine against the bacteria transmitted by ticks, recommended for dogs in high-risk areas.</li>
                <li>Canine Influenza (CIV): Protects against a contagious respiratory disease, particularly important in areas where outbreaks are common.</li>
    
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Vaccines for Cats:</h2>

        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <h3>Core Vaccines:</h3>
                <li>Rabies: Essential for cats, especially those that go outdoors, as they can transmit rabies to humans and other animals.</li>
                <li>Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis (FVR): Part of the FVRCP vaccine, protects against herpesvirus, which causes respiratory illness.</li>
                <li>Calicivirus (FCV): Another component of FVRCP, calicivirus causes respiratory infections and oral diseases.</li>
                <li>Panleukopenia (FPV): A severe and often fatal viral infection similar to parvovirus in dogs, included in the FVRCP combination.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>Non-Core Vaccines:</h3>
                <li>Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV): Recommended for outdoor cats or cats exposed to infected cats, as it suppresses the immune system and can lead to other health problems.</li>
                <li>Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV): Optional and typically administered based on risk factors such as outdoor exposure.</li>
                <li>Chlamydia felis: Protects against respiratory infections, often given in multi-cat households or shelters.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Vaccines for Other Pets:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <h3>Rabbits:</h3>
                <li>Myxomatosis: A virus spread by fleas and mosquitoes, common in outdoor rabbits.</li>
                <li>Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHDV): A deadly disease affecting the liver and other organs</li>
                
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>Ferrets:</h3>
                <li>Distemper: Canine distemper can be fatal for ferrets, so vaccination is important.</li>
                <li>Rabies: Especially important for ferrets that interact with other animals or go outdoors.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>NOTE:</h3>
        <p>
            Following the recommended vaccination schedule for your pet is essential for full protection.<br>
            Vaccines may require initial doses (especially in puppies and kittens), followed by booster shots
            throughout their life<br>. Speak to a veterinarian for tailored advice based on your pet's lifestyle,
            environment, and health risks.
